Debugging Tip

When running tests, you can insert the Ruby command byebug into your app code to drop into the command-line debugger and inspect variables and so on. Type h for help at the debug prompt. Type c to leave the debugger and continue running your code.

Take a look at the code in the class method get_random_word, which retrieves a random word from a Web service we found that does just that. Use the following command to verify that the Web service actually works this way. Run it several times to verify that you get different words.
$ curl --data '' http://watchout4snakes.com/wo4snakes/Random/RandomWord
(--data is necessary to force curl to do a POST rather than a GET. Normally the argument to --data would be the encoded form fields, but in this case no form fields are needed.) Using curl is a great way to debug interactions with external services. man curl for (much) more detail on this powerful command-line tool.
